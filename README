This project was originally designed to allow gamers to communicate
internationally through SMS with a simple web interface, and without 
incurring large international messaging fees. Specifically it's for 
communicating with users in other countries who are reachable through SMS
but not other means. (Allowing for example, Guild/Clan leaders to reach
players who are not at their computers)

Mostly this is just a fun experiment with the twilio api and a few other
fun technologies, but it's not even close to remotely working, I just wanted
to stash it here until I can come back to it.
